**Complete step-by-step installation instructions for beginners**

This guide will walk you through installing the GIMP AI Plugin, even if you've never installed a GIMP plugin before.

---

## 📋 What You'll Need

Before starting, make sure you have:

1. ✅ **GIMP 3.0.4 or newer** installed (download from [gimp.org](https://www.gimp.org))
2. ✅ **An API key** from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com), or a [Venice.ai](https://venice.ai) key for the experimental Venice provider
3. ✅ **Internet connection** for downloading files and using AI features

> **Important**: This plugin requires **GIMP 3.0.4 or newer**. Earlier versions are not compatible. The automated installer will detect all compatible GIMP versions and let you choose which to install to.

---

## 🎯 Quick Overview

The installation process is simple:

**EASIEST METHOD (Recommended for beginners):**

1. Download the release ZIP
2. Extract it
3. Run: `python3 install_plugin.py`
4. Restart GIMP and configure your API key

**The automated installer does everything for you!**

**MANUAL METHOD:**

1. Download 3 files
2. Create a folder in GIMP's plugin directory
3. Copy the files to that folder
4. Restart GIMP
5. Configure your API key

**That's it!** No complex dependencies, no Python packages to install.

---

## 📥 Step 1: Download the Plugin Files

You need **exactly 3 files**:

1. **`gimp-ai-plugin.py`** - The main plugin file
2. **`coordinate_utils.py`** - Helper functions (required)
3. **`ai_providers.py`** - AI provider support (required)

### Option A: Download Release Package with Automated Installer (Easiest!)

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/lukaso/gimp-ai/releases)
2. Download the latest `gimp-ai-plugin-vX.X.X.zip` file
3. Extract the ZIP file
4. Run the automated installer:
   ```bash
   python3 install_plugin.py
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions - it will do everything for you!

> **Multiple GIMP versions installed?** The installer will automatically detect all GIMP 3.X installations and let you choose which one to install to. It defaults to the latest stable version (e.g., 3.0, 3.2 are stable; 3.1, 3.3 are development).

> **Using the automated installer?** You can skip to [Step 7: Configure Your API Key](#-step-7-configure-your-api-key) after running it!

### Option B: Download from GitHub Release (Manual Install)

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/lukaso/gimp-ai/releases)
2. Download the latest `gimp-ai-plugin-vX.X.X.zip` file
3. Extract the ZIP file - you'll see a `gimp-ai-plugin` folder containing all three files

### Option C: Download Individual Files

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lukaso/gimp-ai)
2. Click on `gimp-ai-plugin.py` → Click "Raw" → Save the file (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
3. Go back and click on `coordinate_utils.py` → Click "Raw" → Save the file
4. Do the same for `ai_providers.py`

> **Important**: Keep these three files together - the plugin won't work without all of them!

---

## 📁 Step 2: Find Your GIMP Plugin Directory

The plugin directory location depends on your operating system.

### Windows

1. Press `Windows + R` to open the Run dialog
2. Type `%APPDATA%\GIMP` and press Enter
3. You should see one or more folders like `3.0`, `3.1`, `3.2`, etc. (depending on your GIMP version)
4. Choose your GIMP version folder (use the latest stable version - even numbers like 3.0, 3.2, 3.4)
5. Open that folder, then open the `plug-ins` folder

**Full path example**: `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\3.0\plug-ins\`

> **Tip**: If you can't find the `AppData` folder, make sure "Hidden items" is checked in Windows Explorer's View menu.
> **Multiple versions?** Stable releases use even minor version numbers (3.0, 3.2, 3.4). Development versions use odd numbers (3.1, 3.3).

### macOS

1. Open Finder
2. Press `Cmd + Shift + G` (Go to Folder)
3. Enter: `~/Library/Application Support/GIMP/`
4. Press Enter - you'll see folders like `3.0`, `3.1`, `3.2`, etc.
5. Choose your GIMP version folder (use the latest stable version - even numbers like 3.0, 3.2, 3.4)
6. Open that folder, then open the `plug-ins` folder

**Full path example**: `/Users/YourName/Library/Application Support/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/`

> **Tip**: If the `Library` folder is hidden, press `Cmd + Shift + .` (period) in Finder to show hidden files.
> **Multiple versions?** Stable releases use even minor version numbers (3.0, 3.2, 3.4). Development versions use odd numbers (3.1, 3.3).

### Linux

The plugin directory is at: `~/.config/GIMP/<version>/plug-ins/` where `<version>` is your GIMP version (3.0, 3.1, 3.2, etc.)

First, check which GIMP versions you have:

```bash
ls ~/.config/GIMP/
```

Choose your GIMP version (use the latest stable version - even numbers like 3.0, 3.2, 3.4), then navigate to its plug-ins directory:

```bash
cd ~/.config/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/
```

**If the directory doesn't exist**, create it (replace `3.0` with your version):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/
```

> **Multiple versions?** Stable releases use even minor version numbers (3.0, 3.2, 3.4). Development versions use odd numbers (3.1, 3.3).

### Flatpak GIMP (Linux)

If you installed GIMP via Flatpak, the directory is different:

```bash
~/.var/app/org.gimp.GIMP/config/GIMP/<version>/plug-ins/
```

Check which versions you have:

```bash
ls ~/.var/app/org.gimp.GIMP/config/GIMP/
```

---

## 📂 Step 3: Create the Plugin Folder

Inside your GIMP `plug-ins` directory, you need to create a **subdirectory** named `gimp-ai-plugin`.

### Visual Directory Structure

Your final structure should look like this:

```
plug-ins/
└── gimp-ai-plugin/          ← Create this folder
    ├── gimp-ai-plugin.py    ← Copy this file here
    ├── coordinate_utils.py  ← Copy this file here
    └── ai_providers.py      ← Copy this file here
```

### How to Create the Folder

**Windows:**

1. Right-click in the `plug-ins` folder
2. Select "New" → "Folder"
3. Name it exactly: `gimp-ai-plugin`

**macOS:**

1. Right-click (or Ctrl+click) in the `plug-ins` folder
2. Select "New Folder"
3. Name it exactly: `gimp-ai-plugin`

**Linux:**

```bash
# Replace 3.0 with your GIMP version
mkdir ~/.config/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/gimp-ai-plugin
```

> **Important**: The folder name must be exactly `gimp-ai-plugin` (with a hyphen, not underscore).

---

## 📋 Step 4: Copy the Plugin Files

Now copy **all three files** you downloaded into the `gimp-ai-plugin` folder you just created.

### Where to Copy:

- **From**: Where you downloaded/extracted the files
- **To**: `plug-ins/gimp-ai-plugin/` (the folder you just created)

### What to Copy:

- ✅ `gimp-ai-plugin.py`
- ✅ `coordinate_utils.py`
- ✅ `ai_providers.py`

All three files must be in the same `gimp-ai-plugin` folder!

---

## 🔧 Step 5: Set File Permissions (Linux/macOS Only)

**Windows users can skip this step.**

On Linux and macOS, you need to make the main plugin file executable:

### macOS:

```bash
# Replace 3.0 with your GIMP version
chmod +x ~/Library/Application\ Support/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/gimp-ai-plugin/gimp-ai-plugin.py
```

### Linux:

```bash
# Replace 3.0 with your GIMP version
chmod +x ~/.config/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/gimp-ai-plugin/gimp-ai-plugin.py
```

### Flatpak (Linux):

```bash
# Replace 3.0 with your GIMP version
chmod +x ~/.var/app/org.gimp.GIMP/config/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/gimp-ai-plugin/gimp-ai-plugin.py
```

---

## 🔄 Step 6: Restart GIMP

If GIMP is currently running:

1. **Save your work**
2. **Quit GIMP completely** (don't just close windows - actually quit the application)
3. **Start GIMP again**

> **Important**: You must fully restart GIMP for it to detect the new plugin.

---

## 🔑 Step 7: Configure Your API Key

Now you'll set up an API key so the plugin can access AI features. Pick one provider -
OpenAI, or Venice.ai if you want to try the experimental provider.

### Get an OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click on your profile icon (top right) → "API Keys"
4. Click "Create new secret key"
5. **Copy the key** (it starts with `sk-` and is very long)
6. **Save it somewhere safe** - you can only see it once!

> **Note**: You'll need to add credits to your OpenAI account to use the API. Check pricing at [openai.com/pricing](https://openai.com/pricing).

### Or Get a Venice.ai API Key (experimental)

1. Go to [venice.ai](https://venice.ai) and log in
2. Open the API settings and create a key
3. **Copy and save it** - as with OpenAI, you only see it once

An **inference key is all you need**. The plugin never calls Venice's account, billing or
key-management endpoints. It does read Venice's model catalogue to populate the model
dropdowns, but that endpoint is public and the plugin sends no key with it.

### Enter Your API Key in GIMP

1. In GIMP, open any AI feature (e.g., `Filters` → `AI` → `Image Generator`)
2. Click the **Settings** button in the dialog
3. Choose your **AI Provider**
4. Paste your API key and click **Save**

If no key is configured yet, the dialog shows a warning bar with a **Configure Now**
button that takes you straight to the same place.

The plugin will **automatically save** your API key in GIMP's preferences - you only need
to enter it once.

### Or Use an Environment Variable

If you would rather not store the key in GIMP's preferences, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` or
`VENICE_API_KEY` in the environment GIMP runs in. The plugin checks the config first,
then falls back to the environment variable.

---

## ✅ Step 8: Test the Plugin

Let's verify everything is working:

1. **Open any image** in GIMP (or create a new one)
2. **Look for the AI menu**: `Filters` → `AI`
3. You should see these options:
   - 🎨 **Inpainting** - Fill areas with AI-generated content
   - 🖼️ **Image Generator** - Create new images from text
   - 🔄 **Layer Composite** - Blend layers with AI
   - ⚙️ **Settings** - Configure API keys

### Quick Test:

1. Go to `Filters` → `AI` → `Image Generator`
2. Enter a simple prompt like "blue sky with clouds"
3. Click OK
4. After a few seconds, you should see a new layer with AI-generated content!

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### I don't see "Filters → AI" in GIMP

**Check these things:**

1. ✅ **Did you restart GIMP completely?** (Quit and reopen)
2. ✅ **Are all three files in the right place?**
   ```
   plug-ins/gimp-ai-plugin/gimp-ai-plugin.py
   plug-ins/gimp-ai-plugin/coordinate_utils.py
   plug-ins/gimp-ai-plugin/ai_providers.py
   ```
3. ✅ **Is the folder named exactly `gimp-ai-plugin`?** (not `gimp_ai_plugin` or `gimp-ai`)
4. ✅ **Do you have GIMP 3.0.4 or newer?** Check: `Help` → `About GIMP`
5. ✅ **Linux/macOS: Did you make the file executable?** (Step 5)
6. ✅ **Are you looking in the right version folder?** (Check the version folder matches your installed GIMP)

### "No API Key Configured" Error

1. Make sure you've entered your API key (Step 7)
2. OpenAI keys start with `sk-`; check you pasted the whole key
3. Check for extra spaces when copying/pasting
4. Try removing and re-entering the key

### "Authentication Failed" Error

1. Verify your API key is correct at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Make sure your OpenAI account has available credits
3. Test your API key in OpenAI's playground first

### Plugin Causes GIMP to Crash

1. Check `Windows` → `Error Console` in GIMP for error messages
2. Try with a small test image first (under 1024px)
3. Make sure you're using GIMP 3.0.4 or newer
